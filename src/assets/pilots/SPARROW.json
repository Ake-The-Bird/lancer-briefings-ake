Despite the harsh environment she grew up in, Saba proved she had an aptitude for mechanical engineering and piloting, and as a result, she was enlisted to repair and fly the colony's resource-gathering machines. For several years she got more familiar with these heavy machines before a group of mercenaries arrived on the planet. They took notice of Saba's skills after a quick skirmish and a little bit of Saba's guile they recruited her rather than leaving her to rot. Using her mechanical know-how, Saba quickly rose through the ranks and gained a reputation in the mercenary group. She was given the callsign Raven as she buried her past and focused on honing her piloting abilities with a ruthless, no-holds-barred attitude towards her enemies. When the chance arose she used her success to distance herself even further from her past, and left the raiders who originally brought her into the bigger world.</p><p>Despite her reputation in combat, Saba never forgot her humble beginnings and has always had a soft spot for the folks under oppression, trying to do what she felt was good when opportunity allowed.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":11,"background":"Penal Colonist","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"26db5d8e-69b3-47ef-9ef2-0790545a9854","name":"Shrike","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":16,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":6,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Mon Mar 31 2025 22:25:55 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"f9a93843-e779-4816-adea-5db31f59b527","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_custom_paint_job","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_siege_ram","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"The siege ram is a handheld metal beam with a wedge tip, ready to be smashed into the seams of sealed bulkhead doors and driven home.
